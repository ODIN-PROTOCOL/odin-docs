# Governance and Tokenomics

### Governance

Governance in the ODIN protocol is managed by ODIN token holders through a voting mechanism. Any member holding ODIN tokens can propose changes or support proposals for protocol updates. This democratic approach to governance ensures that the community has control over the future direction of the network. For example, token holders might vote on decisions such as changing the staking rewards rate or introducing new features to enhance data privacy.

- **Protocol Updates**: Protocol updates can be classified as major or minor. Major updates involve significant changes to the architecture, while minor updates are typically backward-compatible extensions. The community votes on these updates, ensuring that changes reflect the collective will of the participants.
- **Validator Responsibilities**: Validators are tasked with verifying transactions, maintaining the blockchain, and ensuring compliance with protocol rules. Validators can be penalized for rule violations, such as double-spending or signing conflicting blocks. This penalty mechanism helps maintain trust and accountability within the network.

### ODIN Token

The ODIN token is the native token of the ODIN system, used for various purposes that contribute to the network's functionality and growth:

- **Staking**: Validators and users stake ODIN tokens to participate in consensus and governance. Staking helps secure the network and aligns the interests of participants with the long-term success of the protocol.
- **Payments**: Tokens are used to pay for data services, transaction fees, and validator rewards. Data consumers use ODIN tokens to access valuable data from providers, creating a dynamic and efficient marketplace for data.
- **Governance**: Token holders can vote on system governance, including protocol rules and validator selection. This gives users a voice in how the network evolves and ensures that decisions are made collectively.

#### Token Distribution

- **Total Supply**: 163.78 million tokens.
- **Allocation**:
  - Company & Founding Team: 21%
  - ODIN Treasury: 25%
  - Data Providers Pool: 2%
  - Strategic Funding & Liquidity: 17%
  - Ecosystem & Marketing: 6%
  - Circulating Supply: 13%

The token distribution is designed to ensure a fair and balanced allocation of resources, supporting the development of the network while providing incentives for participants to contribute.
