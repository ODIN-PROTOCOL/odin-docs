# Getting Started

Let's discover **Odin Protocol in less than 5 minutes**.

## What is Odin Protocol?

ODIN is a decentralized protocol for the web3 data economy and a decentralized
system designed to build a **data oracle network (DON)** based on an open protocol for
interaction between participants and a sustainable economy. The use cases of ODIN
are mainly focused on user generated data apps, Non-fungible tokens, Decentralized
Finance applications and others.

ODIN is a new system that combines the advantages of **cryptography** and
**decentralized technologies**, as well as the simplicity of connecting data providers and
the flexibility of developing contracts to receive and process data from them (to work
with business requirements, which are to increase the scalability and reliability of
circulating data).

### Why Odin Protocol?

Since the emergence of the concept of digital assets and the emergence of Bitcoin
as the first representative of this type, accounting systems have come a long way, the
purpose of which is to expand functionality and adapt to current business
requirements. However, something has remained and will remain unchanged until
now - this is **determinism**. Today there are a large number of protocols that allow
users of different systems to exchange value among themselves. The architecture of
such protocols ranges from using a centralized mediator to resolve disputes to
completely trustless atomic swaps, which allow exchanges to be made, trusting only
that the math works. However, when it comes to the exchange of "live" data between
systems, the situation is not so progressive. Most often, these situations are solved by
attracting one / several oracles, which are bridges connecting the accounting system
and the outside world. Such oracles are centralized, which directly affects the final
system. For example, the huge computing power of Ethereum that checks the rules
of the protocol cannot solve the problem if a centralized oracle provided invalid data,
as a result of which the contract was not executed correctly (despite the
mathematical correctness). Besides the challenges with the oracles systems itself,
the exponential growth of data-for-reward models in decentralized applications
require a reliable automated system for **exchanging usersâ€™ data for the reward tokens
in a secure and compliant manner**.

## Odin's Focus - Decentralization

The main point that ODIN aims to provide is to ensure decentralization. By
decentralization, we mean several important aspects.

### **Permissionless**

The first is that anyone can become a data provider within the
system boundaries. To do this, you do not need to have any permissions - just initiate
a transaction for creating a new data source, in which you determine how this source
can be accessed. This feature allows you to switch from a model (for example), where
only one exchange can provide the ratio of a pair of assets, to a model that allows you
to have thousands of such data sources and allows the end-user to independently
determine which sources will be used and in what quantity. That is, the first step is to
remove the threshold that determines who can be the data source.

### **Validation**

The second feature is that there is no single party that transfers data from
all sources to the system. The information transfer process is also decentralized -
many validators access data sources with the same requests and generate reports on
the information received. Further, these reports are aggregated, and they are already the input for performing operations on the data. In this way, we remove a single
vulnerable side that can transfer data to the system.

### **Open**

And the last feature is that anyone can suggest an algorithm (script) for how
the received data will be processed. Thus, the end-user will have several possible
scenarios for receiving and processing data, which can be performed either jointly, or
the end-user independently chooses a scenario suitable for his case (price, the
reputation of data sources, their number, etc., can play a role here).

The goal of ODIN is not only to create an ecosystem of oracles and open data
marketplace but also to create an economic model suitable for these purposes -
transparent, secure, and understandable.
