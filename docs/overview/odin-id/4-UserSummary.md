# User summary

With the different user profiles (core, shopping, gaming and sports) OdinID creates a per user summary which verifies how trustworthy is a user and its data. This means how much of the user data is trustable and if the user is a real person or a bot.

The summary also enables data consumers to see if the data of specific users is valuable for them or not. By giving away the credential types the users have available and its trust level (Not the data itself), data consumers can decide both if they are interested in buying access to that users credentials and if the user is legit or only a bot which will exploit their dapp. Once data consumer have evaluated the users summaries thay can pay a small fee to get the data they want to profile their costumers.
