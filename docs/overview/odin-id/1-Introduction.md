# Introduction

OdinID is a incentivized self-sovereign identity solution. It allows users to create and manage their identities without the need for a centralized authority or third-party intermediary. It offers privacy protection and transparency by giving users complete control over their data, which eliminates the risk of data breaches, identity theft, and fraud. In addition, users get paid for letting interested Dapps access their data.

## ID agents

There are 3 agents which create the Odin Identity system:
 - **Users**: Individuals which use different dapps and want to get paid for sharing their data with them.
 - **Data providers**: Dapps connected to the OdinID Ecosystem, accepted by the community through Odin's DAO. Data providers will offer users data fields (called credentials) for them to fill their identity.
 - **Data consumers**: Dapps connected to OdinID, which are willing to get information about their users, to get a more accurate profile.


All theses agents will be rated by a ranking algorithm which will get rid of untrusted parties and make trusted ones stand out more. Legit users will get paid more often, legit data providers will get more users due to a better reputation and legit data consumers will get data easily.

This rating algorithm will not only rank agents but credentials themselves, creating different trust levels for specifics fields of users identities. This lets the system create a summary profile for each user which gives dapps deep know how of their constumers.
