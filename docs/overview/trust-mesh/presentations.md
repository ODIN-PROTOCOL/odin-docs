# Presentation requests and presentations

TrustMesh presentation request is a form in which a data consumer asks and specific user for some specific credentials, or to resolve some specific query about one or several credentials. The presentation is the aggregate of creadentials which is used as a response for that presentation request.

For data consumers to be able to access the requested data they will need to pay users with some fixed data access fees in Odin.

**IMPORTANT**: Users also have the option of rejecting the presentation request and not giving away that information.
