# User summary

TrustMesh generates a summary for each user based on their profiles (core, shopping, gaming, and sports). This summary serves to evaluate the trustworthiness of the user and their data, specifically the reliability of the user's data and whether he is a human or a bot.

The summary also enables data consumers to see if the data of specific users is valuable for them or not. By giving away the credential types the users have available on their profiles and its trust level (Not the data itself), data consumers can decide both if they are interested in buying access to that users credentials and whether the user is trustable or not. Once data consumers have evaluated user summaries thay can pay a small fee to get the data they want to profile their costumers.
