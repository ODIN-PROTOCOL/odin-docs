# Introduction

Odin TrustMesh is a incentivized user profiling system. It allows users to create a profile which will gather user data for dapps to access with the user consent adn by paying them some data access fees. It offers privacy protection and transparency by giving users complete control over their data.

## TrustMesh agents

There are 3 agents which form TrustMesh's ecosystem:
 - **Users**: Individuals which use different dapps and want to get paid for sharing their data with them.
 - **Data providers**: Dapps connected to TrustMesh, accepted by the community through Odin's DAO. Data providers will offer users data fields (called credentials) for them to fill their profile.
 - **Data consumers**: Dapps connected to TrustMesh, which are willing to get information about their users, to get a more accurate consumer profile.

All theses agents will be rated by an algorithm which will get rid of untrusted parties and make trusted ones stand out. Legit users will get paid more often, legit data providers will get more users due to a better reputation and legit data consumers will get data easily.

This rating algorithm will not only rank agents but credentials themselves, creating different trust levels for specifics fields in user profiles. This per-field trust rating lets the system create a summary profile for each user which gives dapps deep insights of their constumers.
