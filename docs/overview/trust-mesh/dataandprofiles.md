# Data types and profiles

## Data types

TrustMesh differentiates between two types of data, static and dynamic:
- **Static**: Refers to data that normally doesn't change over time. For example user's native language and birth date are data fields which won't change over time.
- **Dynamic**: Data that changes over time, for example, interests, shopping activity, workout preferences, etc.

This data differentiation allows TrustMesh to create different user profiles for dapps to fulfill with static or dynamic data.

## Profiles

TrustMesh ecpsystem has 4 different profiles for each user which can be divided in two profile types. One Core profile with only static data and 3 behaviour profiles retaled to specific topics, currentyly supporting shopping, gaming and sports. More behaviour profiles will be added in the future.

- **Core profile**: Only contains static data which can be compared easily and can be easily ranked by the trust algortihm. This data is the core of users data and is the most basic profile.
- **Shopping profile**: Related to users shopping behaviour. Mainly filled with dynamic data like shopping frequence, reviews, product categories, etc. This profile is great for data consumers to be able to create more adequate offers to their costumers and understand their needs.
- **Gaming profile**: Filled with gaming behaviour data (platforms, favourite genres, achivements, play time, etc.) making the user able to connect to new games and platforms in seconds, share gaming achievements, get early access to new games and much more.
- **Sports profile**: More focused on users sport activity. Workout preferences, favourite sports, workout sessions, etc. This profile will let users access better deals on sport products and services.

The trust algorithm will use mainly core profile data to create its rates, but behaviour profiles will also affect the trust rate of a user. A user with a more complete profile is likely to have a higher trust rate.Users with complete coherent profiles will be the ones to get the better incentives and deals thanks to the trust algorithm.
