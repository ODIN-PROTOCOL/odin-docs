# Introduction to Data Sources

Data sources are real data providers that are registered on the platform. Anyone can
become such a data provider - for this, it is enough to send a corresponding message
to the system. If this message complies with the protocol rules, the validators will
confirm it, and the participant will become (register) a Data source. This request
specifies the initiator of the request, the owner of the data source, the description,
the cost of the requests, and the content of the executable file that the validators
should run if a request appears on the network to receive data from this source.
