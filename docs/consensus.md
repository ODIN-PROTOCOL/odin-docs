# Consensus Mechanism

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

ODIN uses the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. In this system, network participants who hold ODIN tokens can vote for delegates, who may then become validators. The top 30 delegates with the most votes are selected as validators. This approach ensures that the network remains secure while allowing participants to have a say in who maintains the blockchain.

- **Validator Role**: Validators are responsible for maintaining the blockchain, verifying transactions, and producing new blocks. They are also tasked with querying external data sources and generating reports. Validators are incentivized through rewards for their services, which include transaction fees and staking rewards.
- **Validation Cycle**: Validators reach consensus by signing and exchanging votes during three stages: pre-vote, pre-commit, and commit. A block is considered accepted when more than two-thirds of validators approve it. This multi-stage process ensures that only valid and verified data is added to the blockchain, maintaining the integrity of the network.
