# Core Components

### Architecture

The ODIN Protocol consists of various roles and components that work together to ensure the decentralized and efficient operation of the network. These roles are essential for maintaining the network's security, reliability, and overall functionality. Each role has specific responsibilities that contribute to the overall functioning and security of the network:

- **Users**: Participants who interact with the system by transferring tokens, generating data, or consuming data services. Users can also participate in governance by voting on protocol changes and staking tokens.
- **Validators**: Entities responsible for maintaining the blockchain, proposing, verifying, and confirming blocks. Validators also interact with external data sources and generate reports. They play a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and security of the data being processed.
- **Delegates**: Participants aspiring to become validators. Validators are selected based on the votes they receive from users. Delegates must prove their reliability and commitment to the network to gain the trust and support of users.
- **Auditors**: Participants who maintain a full copy of the blockchain and verify all transactions and blocks, ensuring transparency. Auditors help maintain the integrity of the network by providing an additional layer of oversight and accountability.
- **AI Nodes**: Specialized nodes that provide AI capabilities within the network. These nodes enable dApps to utilize artificial intelligence for data processing, analytics, and other tasks, facilitating the creation of AI-powered decentralized applications.

### Data Consumers and Providers

- **Data Providers**: Entities that register on the platform to provide external data. These data providers can be services that collect and process data, ready to provide it upon request from the network. Data providers are crucial for bridging the gap between off-chain data and on-chain applications, making real-world information accessible to smart contracts.
- **Data Consumers**: Organizations or individuals seeking real-time data. Data consumers use ODIN tokens to pay for the data they request from the network. They can be decentralized applications (dApps), businesses, or individual users who need reliable data for decision-making or executing smart contracts.

### Accounting System

The core of the ODIN platform is its accounting system, maintained by validators. The system stores basic events, the state of data sources, contracts, and cryptographic proofs. All scripts and data sources must be registered within the accounting system for them to be used. The accounting system is fundamental to ensuring that all data interactions are recorded transparently and accurately.

- **Data Storage and Processing**: Data storage and processing can be performed by various decentralized systems, including IPFS and grid computing. Data providers can distribute rewards to participants who store or process data on their behalf. This decentralized approach to data storage ensures that no single entity has control over the data, enhancing security and resilience.
- **End Data Owners**: Users are the ultimate owners of their data, which can include static data, geolocation, health information, financial data, and more. ODIN aims to transform previously unused data into value for users. By allowing users to monetize their data, ODIN creates new opportunities for individuals to benefit from the data they generate.
